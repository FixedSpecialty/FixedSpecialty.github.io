                File I/O with Kotlin is pretty easy to do. First we are going to create an input file that we will be having Kotlin read. We will name it <em>Input.txt</em>. Its contents will be:
            </p>
            <img class="tutorial-image"  src="../resources/images/file-io/file-io-one.png">
            <p>
                Next to read line by line we will first create a file object and give it the input file's name. We then will call the file's <em>forEachLine</em> method. This method will read each line with a reference to the line being refered to by the idetifier <em>it</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To write to a file simply create a file object and pass in the file name you want for it. Then call it's <em>writeText</em> method and pass in a string of what you want to write. Do note that this will overwrite any existing content within the file.
            </p>

                One more thing to note is that because Kotlin's File I/O operations make use of Java's class suite, we also have access to the Java scanner class. With this we can preform even more operations such as scanning a file line by line and printing out each token in the line.
            </p>
