            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                The maze generator is a fun project that can be used to become more familiar with most languages. Many algorithms for maze generation can be found online but I settled on the recursive division algorithm to keep this program short. It starts out by populating the full board with only walls. Then it creates and entrance and exit. There are only 4 possible directions and for every direction it checks for either more walls or more paths.
