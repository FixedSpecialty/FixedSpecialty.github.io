            <h2 class="headings">History</h2>
            <p>
                Kotlin is an OSS statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and Native. The project started in 2010 and was open source from very early on. The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016. Kotlin was invented to solve developer challenges of JetBrains. They needed a simpler tool than Java to work with their main product, called IntelliJ IDEA, totally written in it. The guys investigated the alternatives, stayed unsatisfied, and decided to invent their own language.

            <h2 class="headings">Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main languages to compare Kotlin to: Java and C#. Java due to the reason why Kotlin was created and C# as it was also a derivation of Java. /n
                The similarities between Kotlin and Java is that they can use the same libraries, get compiled into Java ByteCode, and can be easily converted from one to the other. /n
                For differences between Kotlin and Java: Kotlin does not allow null values, it will not compile while Java will compile. Another differnce is class creation and definitions, with Java it requires making the constructor, then getters and setters for each variable. However for Kotlin, only the constructor is needed and it can get and set variables in the constructor. Another key difference is that Kotlin can extend classes without inheriting said class. Then, Kotlin is not nearly as type specific in comparison to Java. /n
                As for similarities between Kotlin and C#, the code structure is similar, with a small few differences. Kotlin does not require ; at the end of each statement, and the way they handle function arguments require a : along with the variable being first and type second for example "(name: String)" /n
                The main difference is that Kotlin can interact with Java libraries easily and C# was meant to handle .net frameworks.
